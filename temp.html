Phill, deciding to be a total genius decides to buy a can of GOYA Baked Beans. And eat them straight out of the fucking can with a plastic spoon. He then shared it with us. The fucking beans man. They were beautiful. TAGS: NYC, bean, phill moment</td> <td>https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/379483092282376202/936216988181737492/unknown.png</td> <td>OLRIZ</td></tr> 

<tr> <td>jon#9401</td> <td>01/21/2018</td> <td>Phillip started his "Don't do drugs" campaign! Not only did he constantly spam "don't do drugs", he also created a server where all he did was name all of the channels and members "dont-do-drugs" and everyone constantly spammed don't do drugs. Definitely one of the most effective anti drug campaigns of all time. Tags: phillip, dont do drugs, server, alexa</td> <td></td> <td>BICZL</td></tr>
