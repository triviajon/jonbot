# jonbot
a python discord bot with irregular features 

will add features list later


you will need to fill in a login.private file stored in the same directory of jonbot.py to use this. the format is as follows:
```
1 ftp host
2 ftp username
3 ftp password
4 
5 datafile 
6 usersfile
7 triviafile
8 bot_key1
9 bot_key2
```
where the first three lines refer to the bot's feature to automatically update html files on an ftp server (which you should probably not use this feature yet, so leave the first few lines of this file blank). line 5 refers to a datafile (csv format) which contains the lore stored by the bot. line 6 refers to a users file where the bot stored the level info of all the users it has seen (json). line 7 should be another json file containing trivia questions, something like:
```
{"0":
  {"question": ...,
  "correct_answer": ...,
  "incorrect_answer": ...,
  "difficulty": ...,
  },
 "1": ...
 }
 ```
 bot_key1 should be the bot key generated by discord, and bot_key2 can also be filled out or left blank, it's just there for ease of testing.
 to setup jonbot for testing purposes with minimal effort, just create empty files called "data.csv", "users.json" and "trivia.json" and fill out a file called "login.private" like so:
 ```
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5 data.csv
 6 users.json
 7 trivia.json
 8 <bot_key from discord dev portal>
 9
 ```
